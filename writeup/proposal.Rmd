# Introduction

Performance persistence is a well-studied trend in the financial literature, particularly involving mutual funds. In general, researchers aim to determine if there is a cross-period effect where fund returns can be predicted using past-period returns.

The performance of sports teams can be measured analogously to mutual fund returns.

# Data and Methodology

Calculations and writeups for this paper are done in the R language, using the RMarkdown package for typesetting and reproducibility in code [@Xie2014, @allaire2015].

## Data

Major sports leagues have come to realize the importance of comprehensive, open datasets. Major League Baseball in particular has been on the forefront of the data revolution. At a high level, we do not require particularly involved data, though. The most important data that we require is number of games won at a per-team level, which is easily found from a variety of sources, and should be easily available for all major sports leagues.

In particular, we use the 

## Repeat performance methodology

There are several measures through which we measure repeat performance.

First, following [@Brown1995] we use a nonparametric contingency table-based methodology to measure repeat performance. We define teams as "winners" or "losers" depending on if they win more games than the median number of games won per team for a given year. Then, we measure the behavior of teams in a 2 year period, that is, they are defined as "winner-winner" for 2014 if they are winners for 2014 and also winners in the 2015 season. 

Then, we use the <b>cross-product ratio</b> to measure repeat performance. 

$$R_{cp} = \frac{WW * LL}{WL*LW} $$

\begin{framed}
$H_{0}^1$: Performance in the first period is unrelated to performance in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} = 1$. \\ 
$H_{1}^1$: Performance in the first period is related to performance in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} > 1$. 
\end{framed}

We can approximate the standard error of the natural log of the odds ratio [TODO: Christensen 1990 p40] as the following:

$$\sigma_{\ln R_{cp}} = \sqrt{WW^{-1} + WL^{-1} + LW^{-1} + LL^{-1}}$$

In the above sequence, we consider a team a winner by its performance relative to the median winrate, which should be roughly 0.500, i.e. 50% winning rate. For the sake of comprehensiveness, we will also measure team performance relative to the 0.500 benchmark.

\begin{framed}
$H_{0}^2$: Performance in the first period is unrelated to performance in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} = 1$.  \\
$H_{1}^2$: Performance in the first period is related to performance in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} > 1$. 
\end{framed}

We also consider a performance measure where teams are considered winners if they make the playoffs.

\begin{framed}
$H_{0}^3$: Making the playoffs in the first period is unrelated to making the playoffs in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} = 1$.  \\
$H_{1}^3$: Making the playoffs in the first period is related to making the playoffs in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} > 1$. 
\end{framed}

Finally, to account for the peculiarities of American League vs National League, the wild-card process, or general nonsense, we will also measure winning rates relative to the "worst" team which does make the playoffs, where worst is defined as fewest wins. 

\begin{framed}
$H_{0}^4$: Winning enough games to make the playoffs in the first period is unrelated to winning enough games to make the playoffs in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} = 1$.  \\
$H_{1}^4$: Winning enough games to make the playoffs in the first period is related to winning enough games to make the playoffs in the second period. That is, $R_{cp} > 1$. 
\end{framed}
